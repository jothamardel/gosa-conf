## Payment Processing Flow

### 1. Payment Initialization
1. User submits form with service details
2. System validates input data
3. User record is created or updated
4. Payment reference is generated (format: `TYPE_timestamp_phoneNumber`)
5. Paystack payment is initialized
6. Service record is created with `confirmed: false`
7. User is redirected to Paystack checkout

### 2. Payment Confirmation
1. Paystack webhook receives payment confirmation
2. Payment is verified with Paystack API
3. Service record is updated with `confirmed: true`
4. QR codes or confirmation codes are generated
5. WhatsApp notifications are sent
6. Admin analytics are updated

### 3. Error Handling
- Payment failures are logged and user is notified
- Webhook failures trigger retry mechanisms
- Database transactions ensure data consistency
- Notification failures are logged but don't block confirmation

## QR Code System

### QR Code Types
- **Dinner**: Individual QR codes for each guest
- **Brochure**: Pickup verification QR codes
- **Convention**: Main registration QR codes (existing)

### QR Code Format
```json
{
  "type": "dinner|brochure|convention",
  "id": "service-record-id",
  "userId": "user-id",
  "guestName": "guest-name",
  "validUntil": "expiry-date",
  "metadata": {}
}
```
