# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of PDF document generation and WhatsApp delivery system for the GOSA Convention Management System. When payments are confirmed, users should receive official PDF documents containing their registration details, QR codes, and service confirmations via WhatsApp. This enhances the user experience by providing professional documentation and ensures users have offline access to their convention materials.

5. WHEN managing blob storage THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling for upload failures and storage limits
6. WHEN accessing stored PDFs THEN the system SHALL provide direct Vercel Blob URLs for WhatsApp document delivery
7. IF blob upload fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to local PDF generation and provide alternative delivery methods

### Requirement 3: WhatsApp Document Delivery with Vercel Blob URLs

**User Story:** As a convention attendee, I want to receive my PDF documents directly via WhatsApp using the Vercel Blob storage URLs, so that I can easily access and save my convention materials on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment is confirmed THEN the system SHALL automatically send PDF documents via WhatsApp using WASender API with Vercel Blob URLs
2. WHEN sending documents THEN the system SHALL use the WASender document sending endpoint: POST https://www.wasenderapi.com/api/send-message
3. WHEN preparing WhatsApp messages THEN the system SHALL use the standardized GOSA message format with personalized details
4. WHEN attaching PDFs THEN the system SHALL provide the Vercel Blob documentUrl and proper fileName to WASender API
5. WHEN formatting messages THEN the system SHALL include GOSA branding, user details, payment information, and instructions
6. WHEN sending confirmations THEN the system SHALL replace localhost URLs with www.gosa.events domain in message text
7. IF document delivery fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and fallback to text message with Vercel Blob PDF link

### Requirement 4: Multi-Service PDF Support

**User Story:** As a user who purchases multiple services, I want to receive appropriate PDF documents for each service type, so that I have proper documentation for all my convention activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN convention registration is confirmed THEN the system SHALL generate registration PDF with QR code and accommodation details if applicable
2. WHEN dinner reservation is confirmed THEN the system SHALL generate dinner PDF with guest details and QR codes for each attendee
3. WHEN accommodation booking is confirmed THEN the system SHALL generate accommodation PDF with booking details and confirmation codes
4. WHEN brochure order is confirmed THEN the system SHALL generate order PDF with delivery information and tracking details
5. WHEN goodwill message is confirmed THEN the system SHALL generate donation PDF with message content and receipt information
6. WHEN donation is confirmed THEN the system SHALL generate donation receipt PDF with proper tax information if applicable
7. IF service has specific requirements THEN the system SHALL customize PDF content and layout accordingly

### Requirement 5: PDF Content Customization

**User Story:** As a convention organizer, I want PDF documents to contain all relevant information and maintain professional appearance, so that attendees receive comprehensive and branded materials.

2. WHEN formatting user information THEN the system SHALL display name, email, phone, and registration ID prominently
3. WHEN showing payment details THEN the system SHALL include service type, amount in Nigerian Naira, payment reference, and confirmation date
4. WHEN embedding QR codes THEN the system SHALL ensure codes are large enough for easy scanning and include backup text codes
5. WHEN adding service descriptions THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of what the user has purchased
6. WHEN including instructions THEN the system SHALL add relevant usage instructions for QR codes and service access
7. IF service has special requirements THEN the system SHALL include specific terms, conditions, or additional information

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Fallback Systems

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling for PDF generation and delivery, so that users always receive their confirmation materials even if primary systems fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF generation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and attempt alternative generation methods
2. WHEN WhatsApp document delivery fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to sending text message with PDF download link
3. WHEN WASender API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue messages for retry and notify administrators
4. WHEN PDF URLs are inaccessible THEN the system SHALL provide alternative access methods and user support information
5. WHEN file size limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL optimize PDF generation or provide alternative formats
6. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
7. IF all delivery methods fail THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and provide manual intervention options

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Payment Flow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want PDF WhatsApp integration to seamlessly work with existing payment confirmation systems, so that the feature enhances rather than disrupts current functionality.
